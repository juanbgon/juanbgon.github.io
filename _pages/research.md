### [**The Impact of Crime on Public Transport Demand: Evidence from Six Latin American Capitals**](files/DGP_CrimePublicTransport.pdf)

<p style="text-align: justify;">Public urban transportation systems are essential for reducing emissions from private transport and mitigating climate change. However, in regions with high crime rates like Latin America, fear of crime in public transport might limit these efforts. This paper studies the impact of crime on public transport demand across six Latin American capitals. A total of 5,160 participants complete three experiments to quantify the impact of crime on public transport choices and policy preferences. We first estimate the willingness to pay for crime abatement on public transport and find that users place a premium of 51% of current fares on safer transport. The high value users place on safety affects their demand for public transport through two channels. Higher crime rates directly reduce the appeal of public transport, hindering the substitution from private options. Crime also reduces the price elasticity of demand for public transport, making subsidies less effective to increase ridership. Taken together, these results show that crime acts as a negative externality on environmental outcomes by affecting the use of public transportation. In fact, participants don’t perceive a trade-off between crime and emissions abatement: we find that higher crime perceptions doesn’t crowd out support from green policies. These results show the environmental externalities of crime through public transport demand, and highlight the need to consider safety in transportation policy.</p>

### [**Reading Minds to Win: Cognitive and Affective Skills in Children’s Strategic Play**](files/tomKids.pdf)  
<small>*With Antonio Alfonso, Pablo Brañas, Isabelle Brocas, Juan Carrillo & María José Vázquez*  </small>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Do children use information to their own advantage? Is this ability related to emotional intelligence? To answer these questions, we conduct a large lab-in-the-field experiment with 1662 participants from 8 to 18 years old who play a game with two-sided private information. We show that participants of all ages understand the fundamental relationship between action and private information. The ability to select payoff-enhancing strategies steadily increases with age but the capacity to recognize subtle variations in incentives triggered by changes in game structure remains elusive even for individuals at their peak cognitive capacity. Remarkably, participants of all ages who have heightened emotional intelligence exhibit a greater tendency to anticipate the behavior of others, best respond to them and, consequently, achieve higher payoffs. The paper thus reveals a strong, robust connection between aective and cognitive theory of mind in young populations. It also highlights the importance of empathic skills for decision making.</p>

## Research In Progress

### [**Selection Neglect in Policing Decisions**](files/GDP_AllCopsAreBayesian.pdf)  
<small>*With Santiago de Martini & Santiago Perez-Vincent*  </small>
<details><summary><small>Abstract</small></summary><small>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Police officers exhibit wide racial disparities when predicting which individuals are more likely to commit a crime. We show this pattern of statistical discrimination can be partially explained by common cognitive biases that distort how officers analyze crime data. This paper focuses on two of these biases: not accounting for the fact that crime data is not a representative sample (selection neglect) and exaggerating differences in criminality across groups (representativeness). We model police inference as a decision maker who infers the type of an individual who belongs to a specific group, when the decision maker only has information about a group-specific prior and an individual signal. In particular, we focus on how representativeness can distort such priors and how selection neglect distorts the perception of the signal. We design a novel framed field experiment to evaluate the predictions of the model and estimate these biases at the individual level, having police officers from across Latin America as participants. Finally, we study whether there is an association between these biases and discrimination of minorities by studying the correlation between the estimated biases and an Implicit Association Test. </p>

### [Juan B. González & Alfonso Sánchez (2022). Multilevel Predictors of Climate Change Beliefs in Africa. *PLoS One.*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266387)  
<small>*This was my undergrad thesis.*  </small>
<details><summary><small>Abstract</small></summary><small>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Although Africa is the most vulnerable region to climate change, little research has focused on how climate change is perceived by Africans. Using random forest methodology, we analyze survey and climate data from second-order political boundaries to explore what predicts climate change beliefs in Africa. We include five different dimensions of climate change beliefs: climate change awareness, belief in anthropogenic climate change, risk perception, the need to stop climate change, and self-efficacy. Based on these criteria we identify five key results: (1) climate change in Africa is largely perceived through its negative impacts on agriculture; (2) actual changes in local climate conditions are related to climate change beliefs; (3) authoritarian and intolerant ideologies are associated to less climate change awareness, and a diminished risk perception and belief that it must be stopped; (4) women are less likely to be aware of climate change, and (5) not speaking French, English or Portuguese is linked to a hindered understanding of climate beliefs. Our combined results can help policy makers better understand the need to jointly consider the multilevel complexities of individual beliefs and hydroclimatic data for the development of more accurate adaptation and mitigation strategies to combat the impacts of climate change in Africa.</p>
