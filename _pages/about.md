I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at **University of Southern California** and a research consultant at the **Inter-American Development Bank**. You can view my CV [here](../files/CV.pdf). 

[My research](../publications/) focuses on applying experimental methods to questions in crime and labor economics. 



In my free time, I like to do [street photography](https://jbxgonzalez.github.io/), and I have also contributed a [R package for data visualization](https://github.com/jbgb13/peRReo).
